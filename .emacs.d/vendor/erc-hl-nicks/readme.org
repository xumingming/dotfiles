* erc-hl-nicks - ERC Module to Highlight Nicknames

** I already have a nickname highlighter, why should I switch?
If you're happy with what you're using, you shouldn't.  (If it ain't
broke...)  BUT, if you are interested in trying something new, here
are some things you should know:
- erc-hl-nicks is based on erc-highlight-nicknames, so it will auto
  colorize nicknames (you don't have to specify colors)
- erc-hl-nicks will ignore certain characters that IRC clients add to
  nicknames to avoid duplicates (nickname, nickname', nickname'',
  etc.)
- I've only tested this on Emacs 24, but there shouldn't be anything
  that prevents it from working on 23.

** Installation
*** Via Marmalade (recommended)
If you are on Emacs 23, go to marmalade-repo.org and follow the 
installation instructions there.

If you are on Emacs 24, add Marmalade as a package archive source 
in ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then you can install it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET erc-hl-nicks RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Manually (via git)
Download the source or clone the repo and add the following 
to ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/erc-hl-nicks")
(require 'erc-hl-nicks)
#+END_EXAMPLE
