;;; Commentary: 
;; 
;; Extend M-x all to be editable M-x occur:
;;   - Show line number before line content (using overlay)
;;   - Can navigate with M-x next-error / M-x previous-error
;;
;; Call M-x all from anything/helm:
;;   1. Call anything/helm command showing lineno and content
;;      such as M-x anything-occur / anything-browse-code /
;;              helm-occur / helm-browse-code etc
;;   2. Press C-c C-a to show anything/helm contents into *All* buffer
;;   3. You can edit *All* buffer!
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put all-ext.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'all-ext)
;; ;; optional
;; (require 'helm-config) ;; or (require 'anything-config)
;;
;; No need more.
