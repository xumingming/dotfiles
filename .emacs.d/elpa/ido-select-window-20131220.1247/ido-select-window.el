;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A very simple alternative to the numerous packages that allow you
;; to easily switch between windows.  When you have more than two
;; windows in the current frame and you invoke ido-select-window
;; you'll be prompted in the mini-buffer via ido to select a window
;; based on its buffer name.
