This is a (very early) GitHub client library for Emacs.

Dependencies:
- pcache.el : https://github.com/sigma/pcache
- logito.el : https://github.com/sigma/logito

The goal is to provide a consistent mapping for the various API versions (v2 and upcoming v3) so that client code might experience a smooth transition.

This library also allows implementation of the various authentication schemes (password, API token, OAuth).

Implementation is heavily based on EIEIO so that various components can be replaced easily.

Current state:
- basic API v3 handler
- functional password-based authentication
- basic but usable low-level Gist API
